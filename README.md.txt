This project is an educational quiz app developed in fulfillment of the Udacity 7dayCode Challenge.

The requirements were to create a quiz layout with at least four different Views, and a method that verifies the answers and displays the final results in a Toast.

I created the layout with 5 questions. 2 checkboxes, 2 radio buttons and 1 text entry.

The App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:

    Text sizes are defined in sp
    Lengths are defined in dp
    Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. By adding a scrollable feature.

Each question has a correct answer.

The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately calculates the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count. 

Below are the correct answers:

    Question 1 - Correct Answer is Any String value. Preferrably a name
    Question 2 - Correct Answer is answer1(Java)
    Question 3 - Correct Answers are answer1 (ImageView) and answer3 (TextView)
    Question 4 - Correct Answer is answer1(Yes)
    Question 5 - Correct Answers is answer2 (Liver) and answer4(Brain)
